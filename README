README for scripts-n-tools

I tweeted a couple of little scripts that I use at coffee shops,
and ntheory suggested that I make a github repository of those
scripts and tools. This is that repository.

It includes Perl, Python and Bash scripts that are great for
quick recon and, with a couple of other tools, could probalby be
enough to own a small company.

Here's the current list:

base64pl.pl		- Encodes/decodes string(s) using base64
charlie_pwniels_band.py - Horizontal brute force tool
convertstr.pl		- Converts a string into various formats
dnsx.pl			- Automates zone file transfers
dumbname.sh		- Get netbios names on local net
forgot.py		- POST exercise in Python
hosts.txt		- hosts.txt for mild.sh
iso8601			- ISO 8601 standard date and time functions
map.sh			- Quickly see what's up on the local net
mild.sh			- Subdomain brute forcer inspired by fierce.pl
netbiowned.pl		- Simplifies windows share enumeration
now.sh			- Map and scan local net
passwords.txt		- Password list
scan.sh			- Nmap shortcut
sshscan.py		- Horizontal SSH scanner
users.txt		- Concise user list

Thanks to ntheory and PHX2600 for the ideas and inspiration.
