README for scripts-n-tools

I tweeted a couple of little scripts that I use at coffee shops, and ntheory
suggested that I make a github repository of those scripts and tools. This is
that repository.

It includes Perl, Python and Bash scripts that are great for quick recon and,
with a couple of other tools, could probalby be enough to own a small company.
